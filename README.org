* My Emacs Configuration
A perpetual work in progress.

I used Emacs almost exclusively for many years. Then, for a time, VSCode became my go-to, mostly to share configs/plugins with colleagues.
Since then, I've settled on vim/neovim; I find the structure of configuration and keybindings a bit more ergonomic. It just feels right. 
Every tool has its niche, and I still prefer Emacs for some envs. I figured it was finally time to organize my config.
