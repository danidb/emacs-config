* My Emacs Configuration
A perpetual work in progress.

I've gone back and forth between several IDEs/editors over the years but I keep coming back to Emacs. I figured
it was time to organize my config properly.

** Installation notes
- The "Hack" font has to be installed separately. See https://github.com/source-foundry/Hack

** Issues, Notes, Todos
- [ ] Startup could be improved, including the startup screen.
- [ ] Personal org is chaotically strewn across files not yet included here.
- [ ] A lot of additional customization for modes I use often isn't included here, yet.
- [ ] There are a few Hydras I've been meaning to add but haven't gotten to yet.
