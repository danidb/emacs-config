* My Emacs Configuration
A perpetual work in progress.

I used Emacs almost exclusively for many years but, for the kind of full-stack work I'm doing these days, I often opt for VSCode.
Every tool has its niche, and I still prefer Emacs for some tasks/envs. I figured it was finally time to organize my config.
This is based on some popular emacs config starters etc.
